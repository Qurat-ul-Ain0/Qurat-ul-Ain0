**Quote I Believe In**

> **Inside every person, there are two forces — one good and one bad. The one that grows stronger is the one we choose to feed**

 if you truly want to learn something, try teaching it to others.

 **The best way of learning is teaching**

This reminds me to stay intentional with my choices and to share what I learn with others.
